# Facebook-Ego-Network-Analysis
This project is a full-scale graph intelligence analysis performed on the Facebook Ego Network (SNAP Dataset), containing 4,039 nodes and 88,234 edges.
This project demonstrates senior-level expertise in:
* Network Science
* Community Detection
* Centrality Analytics
* Structural Vulnerability Modeling
* Information Diffusion Simulation
* Core–Periphery Architecture
* Python (NetworkX)
* Data Storytelling & Business Mapping

This is arguably one of my most complex and technically rich analytical projects — and it shows my ability to think like a systems analyst, not just a data analyst.

## Project Highlights (What Makes This Work Stand Out)
 1. Full Graph Preprocessing & Verification
I validated and reconstructed the network using:
* Graph sanity checks
* Connected component extraction
* Adjacency matrix building
* Preprocessing for all downstream analysis

Result:
- Graph fully connected
- 4,039 nodes in the largest component
- Clean, stable structure for all analyses


2. Formulated 6 research questions and answered all below

### RQ1 — Community Structure & Role Analogy

Using Louvain Modularity, I discovered:
* 15 functional communities
* High modularity score: 0.8349 (indicates extremely strong natural clustering)
* Community sizes ranged from 19 → 548 nodes, showing both micro-groups and mega-clusters.

Interpretation:
These communities behave like natural "role groups", just like students, teachers, admins, parents inside a school platform.
The structure strongly supports circle-based communication.

### RQ2 — Influence Dynamics & Brokerage

Using Degree, Betweenness, Articulation Points & Multi-community bridging, I identified:
* Node 107 as the global communication super-hub
  * Degree: 1,045
  * Betweenness: 0.48
  * Connected to 8 different communities
* Mid-level gatekeepers: 1684, 1912, 3437
  * These nodes bridge 5–6 communities
  * Act as communication “gateways”

Interpretation:
These nodes behave like cross-department communicators, e.g., school administrators connecting multiple role-groups.

### RQ3 — Hierarchical Core–Periphery Architecture
Using k-core decomposition, I uncovered:
* Maximum core index: 115
* 158 nodes in the top core
* These “inner-circle” users form the strategic communication spine
* Outer nodes become increasingly peripheral and less influential

Implication:
This network has a strong hierarchical organization, similar to how a digital school ecosystem has:
core admins → active teachers → students → occasional users.

### RQ4 — Network Resilience & Failure Simulation
I simulated a targeted attack, removing the top 200 most influential hubs.
Result after removal:
* Original LCC: 4,039 nodes
* After attack: 3,750 nodes
* Network stayed operational, but weaker
* Shows high resilience, thanks to redundant connections

Interpretation:
The network is robust, losing even the biggest influencers won’t break communication.
This is valuable for platform design and risk assessment.

### RQ5 — Homophily, Clustering & Triadic Closure
Key findings:
* Global Clustering = 0.6055 → extremely high
* Local clustering peaks at 1.0
* Total triangles: 1,612,010
* Community assortativity = 0.9557 → exceptionally strong

Interpretation:
People cluster tightly.
Friends-of-friends become friends.
Communities remain closed and strongly bonded.
This is exactly how school groups, study teams, and parent circles behave.

### RQ6 — Information Diffusion Potential
Using BFS simulations & global distance metrics:
* Information from ego-node travels to entire network in 6 steps
* Average distance from ego-node: 2.83
* Global diameter: 8
* Global Efficiency = 0.3066
* Cascade simulation shows rapid first-wave spread (1,742 users at step 3)

Interpretation:
This network is excellent for fast broadcast.
Messages spread like wildfire — critical for school announcements, alerts, scheduling changes, etc.

## Business Relevance
This analysis mirrors real-world platform needs:

Identifying core users who keep communication alive

Discovering natural role groups for UI personalization

Understanding spread of information for announcement planning

Testing resilience for system reliability

Understanding relationship patterns to improve engagement algorithms

This isn’t just graph science —
This is how you design smarter digital platforms.
